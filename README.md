German Directory Wordlist
================

Pretty much anyone familiar with CTFs and penetration testing knows the dirb and dirbuster wordlists that are used to discover more directories of web applications. However there was still no word list known to me that is also suitable for German web applications. For this reason I have tried to collect the directories and files that are often found on German websites and convert them into a list. The result is this project. Subdirectories and files can be found through this wordlist.

Obviously, this word list cannot guarantee the completeness and should preferably used with other word lists for enumeration. The wordlist is compatible with url bruteforce tools like [dirbuster](https://github.com/digination/dirbuster-ng), [dirb](https://github.com/v0re/dirb) and [gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster).
